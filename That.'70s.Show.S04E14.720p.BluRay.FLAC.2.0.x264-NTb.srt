1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,980
Hey, guys?
I'm thinking about getting a perm.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,460
Hyde, can I get
the number of your guy?

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,420
I don't have a "guy," dumb-ass.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,740
This righteous moss
is a gift from God.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,220
God gave me a perm, too,
but he hit me below the belt.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,300
What are you doing, Forman?

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,740
My stupid Cousin Penny from Florida
is coming this weekend...

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,980
so my mom's making me
clean the basement.

9
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,140
And I'm done.

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,780
- Penny?
- God, she was always such a tattletale.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,100
"Eric's stealing cookies."
"Eric's playing with fire."

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,660
"Eric's touching himself."

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,580
Yeah, but Eric got her back.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,860
He hit her with the old Ben Gay
on the toothbrush...

15
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,300
and the over-the-shoulder wedgie...

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,780
and the butt-face gas attack.

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,460
- Butt-face gas attack?
- I'll show you later.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,620
Thank you.

19
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,540
My favorite was when you trapped her in the
revolving door at the library and kept spinning her.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,780
Yeah, she ralphed...

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,500
and then she had to keep
walking through the puddle.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,620
'Cause it's a revolving door.

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,660
It spins in circles.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,060
That's its nature.
It just...

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,680
- Penny!
- Aunt Kitty!

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,920
- It's so good to see you!
- Oh, my gosh, you have grown so...

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,840
Things have...

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,200
Good for you!

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,560
And good for us.

30
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh, geez.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Penny.

32
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
You're so... shiny.

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,520
I am just so excited you're here.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
I have lots of free time these days,
so I've gathered up some local foliage.

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,160
And I thought we could have a long talk
while we make our own potpourri!

36
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, thanks, Aunt Kitty, but right now
I'd just like to catch up with Eric.

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,600
Find out how he got so foxy.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,200
Okay, you boys be nice.
But not too nice.

39
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,520
Penny, I know your last trip
here I was kind of a jerk, and...

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,440
Oh, God, Eric!
That was so long ago.

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,720
Plus, I can't stay mad at you.
You're too cute.

42
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,640
- Hey, guys, what's up?
- Oh, hey, you remember my Cousin Penny?

43
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
Hey, Penny. I didn't recognize you
without Eric's butt in your face.

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,080
So, you guys ready for the movies?
You can come too.

45
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
I guess.

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,080
Thanks, but this Wisconsin air
is so dry...

47
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,800
I really should go inside
and moisturize before I lose my tan.

48
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
I have lotion.

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,080
I think the best plan is for all of us
to go to the movies...

50
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,640
except for me and Penny,
who will stay here and moisturize each other.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
What? Screw that,
I'm gonna moisturize too.

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,080
- Michael!
- I'll just do, like, a leg or something.

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,880
Fine!

54
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,040
Come on.
Let me show you to your room.

55
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
- Michael!
- I'm gettin' Kool-Aid!

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,040
Damn!

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,520
What losers!
Did you see them checking her out?

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,200
- Okay, she's not that hot.
- I never liked her.

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
You know, once when we were little
she bit me, so I bit her back.

60
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,960
And then she said, "Truce,"
so I said, "Okay."

61
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,320
And then she bit me again.

62
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,320
Whore.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
Slut.

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,920
- No, her.
- Oh, yeah.

65
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,840
Whore.

66
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,080
Yeah, we'll show Penny
with our new sunlamp tans.

67
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,720
How dare she come into our town
and try to "out-hot" us.

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
I know. I mean, we don't go to her town
and try and "out-whore" her.

69
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Well, she can't just show up all hot,
shaking her butt around our guys.

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,640
If our guys are gonna fantasize about
moisturizing anybody, it should be us.

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,080
Right. But we're not gonna
let them do that, are we?

72
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,800
Let's just hope
it doesn't come to that.

73
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,200
Have you seen that little stray cat
that's been hanging around our house?

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,880
Oh, yeah, I met him this morning.

75
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,440
Then he met the hose.

76
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,200
Kitty, we don't need more things
hanging around our house.

77
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,640
We already have Steven and Kelso...

78
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,200
and "foreign kid."

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,400
Yeah, but they're always busy.

80
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,360
Maybe I should get my own cat.
I'm not working. I'm home all day.

81
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,320
Here's my problem with cats.

82
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,320
Best-case scenario: You get the smartest cat
in the world. He still craps in your house.

83
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,240
Well, it's just, it would be nice
to have something to take care of.

84
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,680
I'll tell you what, Kitty.

85
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,360
Instead of getting a cat,
why don't we all just stop flushing?

86
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,680
It's the same thing!

87
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,760
Guys, I'm getting some weirdness
from Cousin Penny.

88
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Earlier, she gave me a hug,
but this wasn't a cousin hug.

89
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,840
Our middles touched.

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,840
And not just for a second.
She pressed.

91
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,520
I've heard of "kissing cousins." But
have you ever heard of "doin' it cousins"?

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,840
'Cause that's what I think
Forman should be shooting for here.

93
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,760
Kelso, I appreciate the advice, but your
solution to every problem is "do it with her."

94
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Well, it worked with
my old science teacher.

95
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,480
C-minus!

96
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Well, unfortunately,
Penny is my cousin.

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,440
That'd be like looking at my mom and thinking,
"Hey, baby, how"... I'm just gonna stop right there.

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,120
I've thought that about your mom,
but I didn't stop right there.

99
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,720
Surprise!

100
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
This oughta keep you
company during the week.

101
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,440
Roy's Pet Store?
Red, you got me a cat!

102
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,880
Well, it's like a cat.

103
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
A fish?

104
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,600
Red, it's a fish.

105
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,400
See?
It's like a cat.

106
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,280
- They're both pets.
- No, they're not.

107
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,480
Pets are called "pets"
because you pet them.

108
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,680
How do I pet this thing?

109
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,040
Well, you just reach in
and corner it and give it a rub.

110
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,400
That's the thing about fish:
They just love the feel of the human hand.

111
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,560
Jackie! Jackie, wake up.

112
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Oh, my God.
Donna, you're totally burned.

113
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,160
Really?

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,960
What have you done to me?

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,960
Me?
This was your stupid idea.

116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
Did you call me "stupid"?

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,600
- Ow!
- Ow!

118
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,800
- Lobster face!
- Ow!

119
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,320
Little Red Riding Bitch!

120
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,400
Oh, my God!

121
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,960
Okay! Now, okay,
let's just call a truce.

122
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Fine.

123
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
- Ow!
- Ow!

124
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,120
Ow!

125
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,480
Don't look at me.
Mrs. Paul killed these.

126
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,720
Here.

127
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,840
So...

128
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,880
must get pretty boring
living in a fishbowl, huh?

129
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
Gets pretty boring around here too.

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,880
You know, I used to work at a hospital,
and taking care of people...

131
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,280
It felt so good to be needed.

132
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,640
<i>You know,</i>
<i>like... like part of a team?</i>

133
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,400
You know, people really
depended on me, which I kind of miss.

134
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,240
Oh, at least I don't...
I don't miss the bedpans.

135
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,280
Are you sure it's okay
for me to do my yoga in here?

136
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,280
Do Aunt Kitty and Uncle Red
allow girls in your room?

137
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,840
Well, you're my cousin,
so you don't even really count as a girl.

138
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,000
You're like a rock.

139
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,040
A moving, talking,
extremely limber rock.

140
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,280
Ooh, that's nice.

141
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
- Peterson's Auto Shop.
- What?

142
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,360
Peterson's Auto Shop.
That's what my T-shirt says.

143
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,880
I noticed you were trying to read it.

144
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,400
That's... Yes.
Yes, I was.

145
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,080
I, uh... I kinda have, like,
a passion for T-shirt logos.

146
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,360
Okay, well, bedtime for
this logo fan, okay?

147
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,880
Off you go.

148
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,440
Uh-oh.

149
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,640
Naughty thoughts a-brewin'.

150
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,880
Penny, you're cold.

151
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
Go get a sweatshirt.

152
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
Oh. Okay, Uncle Red.

153
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:11,400
<i>Eric, do I have to tell you</i>
<i>to stop staring at your cousin?</i>

154
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,080
Stop staring at your cousin.

155
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,360
<i>Kitty, where's breakfast?</i>

156
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,520
Honey, I'm-I'm running a little late.

157
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,840
I was, um, redecorating Fluffy's bowl.

158
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,280
Kitty, it's a stupid fish.

159
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,080
What?

160
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,240
Cinnamon toast, get on it!

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,800
Oh, so, decided against the sweatshirt.

162
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,240
It's a bold choice.

163
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,520
I saw Uncle Red leaving,
and I wanted to talk to you alone.

164
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,720
See, I kind of have a crush on you.

165
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,960
Okay, Penny, okay.

166
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,560
Look, I don't know what
the laws are down in...

167
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,480
Florida.

168
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,400
But up here, the cousin-lovin'
is really frowned upon.

169
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,960
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

170
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,120
Last week, I overheard my parents talking,
and I found out that I'm adopted.

171
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,440
So, technically,
we're not even related.

172
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,840
Well, that's a twist.

173
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,720
And all those feelings that I had about you
that would've been wrong?

174
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,480
Are pretty freakin' right!

175
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Bring it in.

176
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,240
Now you're warm...

177
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,440
and I don't feel bad about that.

178
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
So Penny's not even your cousin?

179
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,640
All right. Well, in light of
recent developments, I vote "do it."

180
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,680
Do it, yellow belly!

181
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,120
Look, man, if you don't do it...

182
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,360
I'm gonna do it.

183
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,520
Then I'm gonna make fun of you.

184
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,240
All right, fellas.
I guess it's all systems go.

185
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Just... Hey, let's keep
this between us, okay?

186
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,720
Hey, what's up?

187
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,000
- Forman wants to nail his cousin.
- No.

188
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,200
No, no, no, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.

189
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,880
And what the hell
happened to your face?

190
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,360
- What the hell happened to yours?
- Burn!

191
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,080
Yeah, I gotta admit, Donna,
that was a nice burn.

192
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,240
And I don't mean what you said just there.
I mean your face. Nice burn.

193
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,840
Hey, if you ever need a date for prom,
you can just flip through the family album.

194
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,440
Oh, God.

195
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,880
You're just jealous
because Penny is incredibly hot...

196
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,360
and you're a throbbing red pile.

197
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,120
Eric, my sunburn will fade,
but your shame will last forever.

198
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,200
Yeah, well, at least my shame won't... peel.

199
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,200
Hey, there's my girl.

200
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,720
New logo. Nice.

201
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,440
I was just having
a glass of milk before bed.

202
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,360
Oh, well, you know,
you don't have to rush off.

203
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Sit. Come on.
Let's gab awhile.

204
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,680
So...

205
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,440
let's get to the bottom
of this crush, huh?

206
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,600
You know what
I'd really love to do?

207
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,680
Stay up late and watch movies
like we did when we were kids.

208
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,280
Remember?
All alone in the dark?

209
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
That's a good plan.

210
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,680
- And let's wear our jammies!
- Excellent addition to the plan.

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Oh, but I usually just sleep
in a T-shirt and panties.

212
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,760
Is that okay?

213
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,120
Well, so do I!

214
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,280
Er, I mean, you know, man-panties... Er...

215
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,320
Underwear.

216
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,600
- You know what I meant.
- Great. The movie starts at 11:00.

217
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,200
- Don't be late.
- Okay, I won't.

218
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,680
"Man-panties"?

219
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,120
- Kitty? What happened?
- Fluffy died.

220
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,200
Well, if it's any consolation,
fish are never even really alive.

221
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,360
They're just less dead.

222
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,760
I know.

223
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,720
You know, he wasn't good company,
but at least he was company.

224
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,720
Red, I'm unhappy.

225
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,920
Oh! I gotta go to the store.

226
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,480
I am a nurturer.

227
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,160
I am not gonna be satisfied nurturing
something you'd win at a carnival.

228
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,440
Kitty, what do you want?
I'll get you anything you want.

229
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,880
Not a cat.

230
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,160
- I want to go back to the hospital to work.
- Oh.

231
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,800
As long as it's not a cat, I'm good.

232
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,200
Okay, I think what you mean is,
"I'm glad you're doing what makes you happy."

233
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,680
Oh, of course.

234
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,480
And I'm sorry that your fish died.

235
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,040
Don't be.
I flushed it.

236
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,560
Good evening, milady.

237
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,200
11:00, on the nose.

238
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,360
Well, we're all alone.

239
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,920
I told Hyde to amscray for a while.
So go ahead, take off your robe.

240
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,400
Penny, there's no rat...

241
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't, Eric! Don't!

242
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,840
- No, I was...
- Eric, step away from your cousin.

243
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,240
No, she's not my cousin.
She was adopted.

244
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,680
- I'm not adopted.
- Wh-What? What? She's lying!

245
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,960
Eric, I saw her mother
give birth to her.

246
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,000
Now, what is going on?

247
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,400
I'm... sleepwalking?

248
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,560
And I'm about to be
"sleepkicking" your ass.

249
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,480
Eric, what kind of person would lie about
something as serious as being adopted?

250
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,040
A liar who specializes in adoption lies:
You. A mean, vindictive person.

251
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,920
- Like someone who would trap someone in a revolving door?
- Yes! Ohh.

252
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,800
Mom, Dad, can... can Penny and I
be alone for a minute?

253
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,040
No!

254
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,320
I'm not raising any flipper grandkids.

255
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,960
No. Look, I just want
to apologize to Penny.

256
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,760
Fine. When you're done,
you head right upstairs.

257
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm having Pastor Dave come over
for an emergency house call.

258
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,160
I guess this will teach you to play pranks
on innocent little girls.

259
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,040
This has taught me a lesson.

260
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,000
And that is that I'm not gonna rest until
I get you back <i>way worse</i> than you got me!

261
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,720
Which by the way,
wasn't really that bad!

262
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,840
Actually, it's pretty bad.

263
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,620
Cousin Penny went back home, huh?

264
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,020
Oh, wait, did I say cousin?
Yeah, I meant cousin.

265
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,860
Looks like that's two hot girls
you can't have.

266
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,980
Well, thank you for such
a conservative estimate.

267
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,220
- By the way, Donna, here's your copy of the pictures.
- Oh!

268
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,740
If you flip through 'em real fast,
it looks like Eric's running.

269
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,740
Gimme those.

1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,880
Hey. L'Eggo my Eggo.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
Hey. L'Eggo my foot
in your ass.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,520
Oh. Good morning.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,240
Oh, here, honey. I brought you something
back from the hospital.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,640
A lollipop.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,200
Mom, I'm 17 years old.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,560
Which is why I also
brought you condoms.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,120
Well, see, we had a teenage mom
come in, and it's just...

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,400
Well, you know,
I worry about you.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,320
That I'll get pregnant?
You're not a good nurse.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,880
Now, don't be a porky mouth.
Oh. Here. Sexual health pamphlets.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,760
I just want you to know
that intercourse...

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,960
is a responsibility,
not just a right.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,320
Okay, well, this couldn't
be more uncomfortable.

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,760
Oh, uh,
don't forget your condoms.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,760
I was wrong!

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,160
Hey, man, Red's been
spot-checking my room again.

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,120
I can't believe
he still doesn't trust me.

19
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,040
You know,
that really hurts, man.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,400
I'm gonna need you
to hide my stash.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,840
Sure. I'll put it in my dresser
under my Hong Kong Phooey socks.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,320
He can protect anything,
because he's faster than the human eye!

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,640
You guys, the funniest thing
just happened to Jackie.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,320
Michael, the most horrible thing
just happened to me.

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,000
My father found out
we're back together.

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,520
And if we don't break up,
he'll never give me any money ever again.

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,200
Wait. If you break up
with Kelso, you'll be rich?

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,160
Talk about your win-win.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,000
Hold on.
He didn't know we were dating?

30
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,600
Here comes the best part.

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,560
I mean the worst part.

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,680
My dad thinks you're a bad influence on me,
so I kept our love a secret.

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,400
And now, I have to decide
between you and money.

34
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,560
Gosh. It's like
<i>Sophie's Choice</i> for morons.

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,440
Hey, let's take a poll.

36
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,720
Who thinks Sophie
should keep Kelso?

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
- The money?
- Ooh!

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,080
- You guys, this isn't a joke.
- But it's funny like a joke.

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,600
How do I choose between something
that makes my whole life complete...

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,200
and you?

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,880
Well, I don't know, baby,
but I love you.

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh, Michael,
I love you too.

43
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,520
Okay, I choose love.
I choose love!

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,440
Aw!

45
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,840
Yeah, aw!
Okay.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,320
Now get a job, because
I need a ton of money.

47
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,520
Guys, I would like you to meet Point Place's
new foreign exchange student, Thomas.

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,840
- Hey.
- What's up?

49
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,440
Hello, pretty lady
with eyes like the sea.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,680
No. Which sea?

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay, easy there,
Casa-new-guy.

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,920
I'm showing Thomas
the ropes.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,720
- Hello.
- What, are you crazy?

54
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
That's Nicole Mayzell.
She's way out of our league.

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,360
Oh. Then we must be
in different leagues...

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,680
because I just had
sex with her last night.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,280
Oh-ho-ho!

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,040
New foreign guy: <i>uno.</i>
Old foreign guy: Nada.

59
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,000
This is outrageous!
The closest I have come to sex...

60
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,920
was when the football team pinned me down
in the shower and made me kiss my own ass!

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,880
Hey, um, if you think
that's close to sex...

62
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,480
then you're gonna be delighted
with actual sex.

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,600
Yeah, Thomas, you should stay away
from the football team for a while.

64
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,040
We wouldn't want a cutie
like you to get hurt.

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Oh, the football team loves me.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm their new placekicker!

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,360
What?

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Oh, the room is spinning!
How did you do all this?

69
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,280
I have delightful accent.

70
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,200
So do I.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,880
Yes, but a nerd
with an accent is still a nerd.

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,040
Now, good day, sir.

73
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
<i>I</i> say "good day."
Now, good day.

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,000
- Good day.
- Good day.

75
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,960
- I said, good day!
- I said, good day!

76
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,360
- He stole that from me.
- But, Fez...

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,000
I said, from me!

78
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,080
Oh, I'm out.

79
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,480
Out?

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,200
I am home one night this week,
and you're out?

81
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,360
Hey, don't look at me.

82
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,760
You had a whole bag of 'em,
and you wasted 'em on Eric!

83
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,120
He's probably down there
making balloon animals.

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,240
Well...

85
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,520
I guess we'll just sleep.

86
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,320
Well, couldn't we just, uh...

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,600
You know, I mean, really,
what are the chances?

88
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,040
We could have a change-of-life baby!

89
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,600
Oh, crap.

90
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,920
I'll be right back.

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,040
It's late.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

92
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,640
Oh, my God.
My sock drawer.

93
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,560
I'm dead! He found your stash!
Do you know what this means?

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,080
Yeah. I get your room,
and you get sent to military school.

95
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
Eric caught me stealing his...

96
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,200
things.

97
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,640
That's not funny.
I'm a grown man.

98
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,120
I don't go rummaging around
in teenage boys' drawers...

99
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,160
- looking for... things.
- Condoms.

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,880
That word is forbidden!

101
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay. Good night.

102
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,320
- Condoms.
- Quit it!

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,320
I don't know.
I've just always been good-looking.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,360
Look at that foreign bastard...

105
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,400
cracking up the whores.

106
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,200
Checking the score.
Old foreign guy: Nada.

107
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
New foreign guy: <i>dos.</i>

108
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Hey, if I pretend to say something funny,
will you laugh?

109
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

110
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,960
That Thomas is shady.

111
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,200
But have you noticed he never says
what country he's from?

112
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,920
What country are you from?

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,600
What country are you from?

114
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,360
America.

115
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Fine.
Mystery solved.

116
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,920
Psst. Mom.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,040
- Is Dad around?
- No, I think he's upstairs.

118
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Hot!
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

119
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Love you, Mom. Thanks for breakfast.
See ya tonight. Bye.

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,920
Psst!
Kitty, Eric around?

121
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,120
No. He just left.

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
Perfect!

123
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,080
Red, this is just silly.

124
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't avoid
Eric forever.

125
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,240
- I know that.
- Well, good.

126
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,600
I just have to avoid him
till he goes to college.

127
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,520
What's that, like, a year?
I can do that.

128
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,320
Hey.

129
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,120
Michael, I'm broke.
I had to buy generic hair conditioner.

130
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,680
And now, I have split ends.

131
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,920
Oh, no one is gonna
notice that, baby.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,480
They'll all be looking
at that monster zit.

133
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,960
I have to ration my cover-up.
So find a job already!

134
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm tryin', okay?
It's tough out there.

135
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,800
I just had an interview at that new store
in the mall, the Cheese Palace.

136
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,480
- Where curd is king?
- The very same.

137
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,280
They're hiring a new cheese maiden,
you know, to hand out the samples.

138
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,000
- But I didn't get the job 'cause they want a girl.
- But you're pretty like a girl.

139
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you!

140
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,240
Man, but the manager wants an actual girl...
you know, with boobs and stuff.

141
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,760
Hey, you know who's an actual girl
with boobs and stuff?

142
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,240
Oh, Donna, you don't have
to get a job just for me.

143
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,680
I was talking about you,
pimple chin.

144
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

145
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,960
I am not getting a job.

146
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
A job is for poor people.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,400
I am a rich person
who doesn't have money.

148
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,920
Big diff.

149
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,640
Hey, is that a blackhead?

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,040
No!

151
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,920
Cheddar? Cheddar?

152
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,880
Cheddar?

153
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,580
Try the Swiss.
You can't miss.

154
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,820
Try the cheddar!
It's even better!

155
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,500
The floor's real shiny,
and I see your heinie.

156
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,460
- Oh!
- Hey!

157
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,900
The cheese maiden hit me!

158
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,780
Cheese guards, seize her!

159
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,260
My God, this job is awful!

160
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,100
Are you sweating?

161
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,940
I mean,
is work making you sweat?

162
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,180
No. I'm glistening!
It's glisten!

163
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,180
Whatever it is... Yech!

164
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,140
Look, Michael...

165
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,460
the only reason I have this job
is so that you and I can be together.

166
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,780
All you've done for our love
is sit in a basement eating Fritos.

167
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,700
Well, for your information...

168
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,140
if I send in
80 empty Frito bags...

169
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,660
I get a free
remote-control car...

170
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,980
which I was gonna
give to you...

171
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,100
after I played with it
only a little.

172
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,740
Now, that is love!

173
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,820
Thomas!

174
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,820
Thomas!

175
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,580
Thomas!

176
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,180
What I have to do is show everyone
that I am cooler than Thomas.

177
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,140
You know, I once saw the Fonzie
do something on TV...

178
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,500
that just might do the trick.

179
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,620
I am now going to jump over
a shark on water skis...

180
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,220
to prove that I'm the coolest
foreign exchange student in Point Place.

181
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,340
- He'll never make it.
- Shut up. He can do it.

182
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,540
He's the Fez!

183
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,340
Okay, here I go.
Hit it!

184
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,140
- Oh!
- He's crazy, man!

185
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,340
- He's crazy!
- He's at the ramp!

186
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,700
Ay!

187
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,620
- Yes!
- Yeah, man!

188
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,580
You suck, Thomas!

189
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,100
Fez, you jumped that shark,
and you're not even wet.

190
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,900
That's 'cause
I'm cool-a-mundo.

191
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,860
Ay!

192
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,340
So, what do you think?

193
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,540
Not only is that the worst idea
I've ever heard...

194
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,460
it was the worst moment
in television history.

195
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,700
Yeah, you're right.
I stopped watching after that episode.

196
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,700
Thomas!

197
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,500
This is freaky, man.
Red hasn't said anything about the stash...

198
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,340
which can only mean he's gone
to the much-feared stage: Beyond yelling.

199
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,300
He's gone Darth Vader, man.

200
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,020
Or... instead of
Red snagging you...

201
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,420
maybe you snagged Red...

202
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,340
dipping into Hyde's stash!

203
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,620
I'm just sayin',
everyone's tryin' it.

204
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,980
I guess Kelso's right.
Everyone is trying it.

205
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,260
I'm tellin' ya, this stuff
isn't just for cakes.

206
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,180
It's great all by itself.

207
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,500
Mmm!

208
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,300
Wait, wait. Watch this.

209
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:18,420
Look at me.
I'm Whipped-cream Head!

210
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,700
Fear me!
All fear Whipped-cream Head!

211
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,220
Mmm!

212
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,660
Kelso, that was delightful.

213
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,580
But the only part you left out
is where Red kills me!

214
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,820
Forman, it was my stash.
I don't wanna leave you hangin'.

215
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,500
But I'm gonna.

216
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,700
So good luck
in military school.

217
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,940
How exciting!
My first American road trip.

218
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,500
I can't wait
to see Lake Dill-hole.

219
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,140
Well, the wait is over.
We're here.

220
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,020
Now, hop out,
you crazy son of a gun.

221
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,460
This is the Michigan border.

222
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,860
- Well, what do you know.
- So where is Lake Dill-hole?

223
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, it's right there
behind the Get Bent Memorial.

224
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,180
So get bent, dill-hole!

225
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,700
What's the score now?
Oh, here we go.

226
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,340
Fez: One. Thomas:
Stranded in Michigan!

227
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,060
Oh, I kill me.

228
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,220
Nice job.

229
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,340
Thanks.
I learned from the best.

230
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,300
Thanks.

231
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,540
I would've taken his clothes.

232
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,700
That's why you're the king.

233
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,100
The Gouda's so good-a.

234
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,300
The Havarti's a party!

235
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,020
Hello, milady.

236
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,380
- "Fondue" you love me?
- Stop doing that!

237
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,220
All day with this.
"Hey, 'fondue' me."

238
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,580
"Ooh, I stepped
in 'fon-dog-due.'"

239
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,820
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

240
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,700
Michael, a few minutes ago,
I smelled stinky cheese...

241
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,860
and it was me!

242
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,540
Look, I'm sorry.
I love you, but I can't do this.

243
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,740
You mean,
you can't "fondue" it.

244
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,340
God, will you shut up!
Look, I am not cut out for work.

245
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,260
I'm cut out for having
rich people give me things.

246
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,380
But you got a job for me.
I mean, doesn't that make you satisfied?

247
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,380
Oh, my gosh!

248
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,020
It's a check!

249
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,940
And that's my name!

250
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,860
Mine!

251
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,660
So we can stay together!

252
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,220
- Yeah, and I can still be rich!
- Yeah!

253
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,620
Well, if this isn't gonna go badly,
I'm heading home.

254
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:05,100
No, wait.
Jackie deserves a celebration.

255
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,820
Hey, let's go buy me
that remote-control car!

256
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,860
No, Michael.
Money doesn't grow on trees.

257
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,860
Money <i>doesn't</i> grow on trees!

258
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,100
You know, I think
having a job is changing me.

259
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,500
Okay, think about it.
A whole new me.

260
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,780
That'd be great.

261
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,580
- I gotta... - I'm gonna...
- Okay, enough!

262
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,780
You, sit.

263
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,220
You can't make me join the army, okay?
I'll cut off a toe!

264
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,740
- What?
- Okay, okay.

265
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,140
We are just gonna
clear the air.

266
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,100
Right now.

267
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,260
Now, Eric, the other night...

268
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,500
your father and I
were getting intimate...

269
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,460
And we realized
we didn't have any protection.

270
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,900
For hugging.
We just...

271
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,180
We hug.

272
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,100
So your dad went to your room looking
for one of those condoms I gave you...

273
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,020
and you caught him, and he has just been
so embarrassed ever since.

274
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,260
Condoms?

275
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,260
Oh! Condoms.

276
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,100
Yeah, condoms.

277
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,020
What did you think it was?

278
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,420
What did <i>you</i> think it was?

279
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,500
What did you do?

280
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,180
What did <i>you</i> do?

281
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,820
I-I didn't do anything.
Okay?

282
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,300
You stole condoms!
Get him, Mom.

283
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,620
- You're grounded.
- For a week.

284
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,220
Hyde too.

285
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,540
Whatever was in that drawer that you
didn't want me to see, I'm sure it was his.

286
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,860
Fine. No complaints here.
Thank you.

287
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,300
You suppose there was actually something
in that drawer he didn't want us to see?

288
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,020
Who cares?

289
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,400
I know in orientation we talked
about theft in the workplace...

290
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,800
so I would like to report
a theft from my check.

291
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,000
Now, I don't know who FICA is...

292
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,320
but that bitch stole,
like, 10% of my money.

293
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,720
Also, now, I don't know if you have
this key in your typewriter...

294
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,280
but when I write "Jackie,"
I like to dot my "I" with a smiley face.

295
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,800
Also, now, I put this
in the suggestion box, but...

296
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
You have something
hanging from your nose.

297
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Oh, and I want Saturday off.
Thank you. Bye.

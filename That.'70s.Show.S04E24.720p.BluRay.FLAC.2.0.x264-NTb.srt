in tonight's <i>Spring Sing...</i>

Great, something
to put my gum in.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,900
Just kidding.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,900
Oh, man, this
concert's tonight?

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, it's tonight. I've been
talking about it for weeks!

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,400
- Don't you listen to me?
- Fez, I don't know what
you're getting so upset about.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,800
- You know we don't listen to you.
- Yeah, I don't know, Fez.

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,000
I mean, I'm still kind of tired
from the party last night.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,900
Party? What party?

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,200
You know, the party.
You were there.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,700
No, I do not know,
and I was not there.

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,700
- Someone forgot to tell me.
- Wait, are you sure?

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,700
'Cause I could have sworn
you were there.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,400
Remember when the college girl got up
on the table and took her top off?

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,400
- What?
- Yeah, that was great, man.

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,500
Wait, even Smokey
the Bear was there?

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,500
Fine. Fine,
what's done is done.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,800
The important thing is where you're going
to be tonight- at my concert watching me.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,500
Oh, it's gonna be
such a wonderful evening.

21

I just heard Wayne Newton.

48

Mr. and Mrs. Forman!
You came to my concert!

Well, it's the <i>Spring Sing.</i>

rather be than the <i>Spring Sing.</i>

that's just a lie.

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Ay, here comes my music teacher,
Mr. Wilkinson.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,100
He is unpleasant.

54
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,500
Are you the parents of
this horrible little man?

55
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,200
I'll have you know, he's been
imitating my accent behind my back.

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,200
Well, first of all,
we are not his parents...

57
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,100
and second of all-

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,100
Well, the rest of it,
I just don't care about.

59
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,300
I'm moving you
to the back row...

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,100
so that no one can hear that squawk box
that you call a voice.

61
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,700
The back row? But the back row is for
the untalented and the ugly!

62
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,500
- Ay, you are no fun.
- Music is not about fun.

63
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,500
It's about passion
and commitment.

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,200
Have you ever been moved to tears
by the warbling timbre of your own voice?

65
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,200
No, because I am a man.

Well, he just, um-

He doesn't seem
to like you at all.

69

The British have
always hated my people.

Oh, good one, Fez.

72
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,900
Well, you certainly
seem in high spirits.

73
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,300
Of course.
Soon all of my friends are gonna be here...

all like a family.

1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,780
Oh, Hyde, get this.

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,700
Casey just came by
to pick up Donna...

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,580
and he was out in the street
just revving his Trans Am real loud...

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,500
and then he peels out
in the street...

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,780
and he started
doing doughnuts.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,300
And then, out comes Donna,
all smiling...

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,380
and, like,
looking at him.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,900
What a slut!

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,700
Look. If she wants
to date him, that's fine.

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,540
But he doesn't have to be
all loud and jerky about it.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,740
Jerky, loud, doughnut jerk.

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,060
Oh, guess what, boys.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,260
I entered the big wiener contest
at the Piggly Wiggly.

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,580
And I won a year's supply
of all-beef hot dogs!

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm a wiener winner!

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,580
Well, anyway,
we're having a barbecue.

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,820
No, Kitty! I thought we were
going to talk about that.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,260
Mm-hmm. Oh, and I saw Donna
at the grocery store...

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,220
and she said she's bringing
her friend Casey.

20
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,940
What? No.
I hate Casey.

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,140
He's Donna's new boyfriend.
Y-You have to uninvite him. Dad, tell her.

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,820
Kitty, you've done
a horrible thing.

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,180
It could scar the boy
for life.

24
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,900
Now, let's do the right thing
and cancel that barbecue.

25
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,580
No. We're having it,
and it'll be fun.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,500
And... we just...
We won't give Casey any relish.

27
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,180
All right!

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,220
Once Casey finds out he's not getting
any relish, he'll dump Donna for sure.

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,660
You are so screwed.

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,960
So your mom invited Casey
over for hot dogs?

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,520
Well, that's a plump,
juicy all-beef burn.

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
Ah, it's just typical
women stuff.

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,240
Like Jackie
kissing that guy. Ow!

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,440
- Hyde!
- Yeah. Okay?

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,000
I've decided if anyone brings up
any more stupid girl stuff...

36
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,720
I'm gonna throw something
at 'em.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,920
This time, I threw a fist.

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,160
I'm sorry. It's just
everything reminds me.

39
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,200
Like, last night <i>Rocky</i> was on...

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,480
and I was thinking I'm like Rocky
and Jackie is Apollo Creed.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,880
And she bashed in my face
by kissing that guy!

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,520
At least Rocky
wins in the end.

43
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,840
Kelso, Rocky loses.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,560
Oh, yeah? Well, why is he
jumping around all happy?

45
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,480
Because he goes
the distance, fool.

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,320
He loses the fight,
but he wins in life.

47
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,680
Who wants to watch a movie
with a message like that?

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,920
Ice-cream man!

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
You guys, I've been thinking
about Donna. And I...

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,720
This time I threw a magazine.

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,600
No, guys, seriously.
This barbecue might work out in my favor.

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,800
You see, Donna's only seen Casey
around his smelly, tattooed...

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,280
Molly Hatchet-lovin' friends.

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,600
But when he comes to the barbecue,
he'll be around us...

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,680
good, clean,
Lynyrd Skynyrd-lovin' Americans.

56
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,160
And the comparison
will not be kind to him.

57
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,920
And then Donna'll come
running home to you.

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,840
No.

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,920
Well, maybe.
You think?

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,840
So, instead of pounding Casey like you
should, you came up with this zany scheme.

61
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,960
Forman, you've officially
turned into Daffy Duck.

62
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,280
You're "dithpicable"!

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,640
You know, I have
lady problems too.

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,760
Rhonda won't let me
get past second base.

65
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,840
I even said, "please."

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,600
Magic word, my ass!

67
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,640
Y-You know what,
Jac... I can't do this.

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,640
Why should I paint these round, berry toes if
some other guy is gonna end up lickin' 'em?

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,120
Michael, what are you
talking about?

70
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,720
I still can't get over
you cheatin' on me.

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,640
And I need to hear you
apologize again.

72
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,840
And this time, maybe you
should cry or give me money!

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,920
No, Michael.
I am not gonna beg for forgiveness.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,880
I didn't make <i>you</i> do that
when you cheated.

75
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,680
Well, that is
totally different.

76
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,480
When guys cheat, it's because
they need some hot action.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,080
But when girls cheat, it's way worse,
'cause girls don't even like sex.

78
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,680
We do too.

79
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,400
Well, why aren't we
doin' it now?

80
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,360
Because I don't want to
do it right now.

81
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,440
I do. Point made.
Thank you!

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
No. You know what?
We need help.

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,680
We should consult the world's
highest authority on relationships.

84
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,600
<i>Cosmo!</i>

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,560
"Why you should touch
your breasts every day."

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,240
No, this could help.
They seem smart.

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,760
Okay, Fez, when Casey gets here, ask him
for advice about your second-base problem.

88
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,120
My advice is gonna be
way better than his, and, uh...

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,240
Donna will see that
he's a greasy dolt.

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Hey, Forman,
I have an idea.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Set up a wacky system
of ropes and pulleys...

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,440
and when Casey gets here,
drop an anvil on his head.

93
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,800
- Because that's what Daffy does.
- Yeah, I got that.

94
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,160
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,240
Hey, Foreplay.
Getting a little shaggy up there, buddy.

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,640
Okay. Well, that's
enough of that!

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Okay.
So, uh...

98
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,600
Hey, you guys
are just in time.

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,280
Fez was telling me about, uh, some kind
of problem you're having with Rhonda.

100
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,880
Yeah. Rhonda won't let me get past second
base, and I really want to explore further.

101
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,680
Mmm. Gosh.
Well, I don't know...

102
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,040
I think if you're patient,
and you're respectful...

103
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,200
when Rhonda's ready,
she'll, uh... she'll wave you over.

104
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,960
Well, thank you, Eric.
That is very gentlemanly advice.

105
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,400
Gentlemanly?
Well, uh, guilty as charged, I guess.

106
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,080
Hey, Casey, uh,
what do you think?

107
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,320
Well, sometimes
a seasoned lady like Rhonda...

108
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,400
she's gotten used to
the usual order of things.

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,760
So, I think the next time
you're fooling around...

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,600
just, uh, skip second
and go right to third.

111
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,920
- What?
- It's genius!

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,400
No wonder
you never get any.

113
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah, with Rhonda, you know,
that just might work.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,360
W-Wait, you like that?

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,280
Well, the words are wrong, but they
sound so good coming out of his mouth.

116
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,040
I got a way about me.

117
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,240
That worked out...
"thuper."

118
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,040
Okay, Michael. I found something out
about our situation.

119
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
This article says that cheating
is a symptom of a deeper problem.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,880
Deeper problem?

121
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,960
No! I don't want a deeper problem!
I want a quick fix!

122
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,080
Well, too bad.

123
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Because I realized that I'm still hurt and
angry from all the times you cheated on me.

124
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,080
Okay? And that is why
I kissed that guy.

125
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
So what are you saying?

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,960
I'm sayin',
I'm not sorry.

127
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm not sorry!

128
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,560
Come on!

129
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,840
Look, now I know
why I cheated.

130
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,440
You need to read this <i>Cosmo</i>
and find out why you did.

131
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,800
I ripped out the boob pictures,
so don't bother looking.

132
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,360
Hey, Donna, uh,
would you like a hot dog?

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Um, maybe half.

134
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,120
Whoa, man,
you carry a knife?

135
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,680
Yeah. You never know when a lady's
gonna need a half a hot dog.

136
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,600
It's funny man. You're the Boy Scout,
but I'm the one who's prepared.

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
He's like a gladiator.

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,280
Okay, that's it. I'm bringing out
the big guns. Oh, yeah.

139
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,240
I'm introducing him
to my folks.

140
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,760
Oh, hey, Mom, meet Casey.
This is Donna's new boyfriend.

141
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,720
Well, you're certainly not a girl!

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,360
Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Forman.

143
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,720
You know, you couldn't have picked a prettier
day to win a year's supply of hot dogs.

144
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,960
Yeah, sure is a hot dog.

145
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,360
Mom!

146
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,640
Sorry, honey, it's just...
He's just...

147
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,880
I am sure
you are much smarter.

148
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,160
Kitty, the idiot neighbors
drank all my beer.

149
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,120
Uh-oh. You're in a bad mood.
Hey, meet Casey.

150
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,360
Pleasure, sir.

151
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,560
Hey, maybe I can help.

152
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,720
I always keep an spare case
of beer in the Trans Am.

153
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,920
Little tip I picked up
in the army.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,720
I don't know.
Seems like a pretty good kid.

155
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,640
Uh-huh.

156
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,640
So, you and Casey, huh?

157
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,240
Look, Hyde, whatever you heard
about Casey, he's changed now.

158
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,640
He's... He's mature.

159
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,120
Oh, yeah.
He's real mature.

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,040
Well, I like him!

161
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,800
We're together, and if you can't deal
with that, then you can just go to hell!

162
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,160
Hey, that's not barbecue language,
young lady!

163
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,600
Here's that beer, sir.
I got a soda for the minor.

164
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,360
Now, you make sure
to drink that real slow...

165
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
'cause I don't want you
to get a tummy ache, little guy.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,840
Well, that's thoughtful.

167
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,080
Yeah, he cramps up easy.

168
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,060
Casey and Donna, man.

169
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,020
Hey, remember when we were 12?
We didn't even like girls yet.

170
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,660
I liked girls
when I was 12.

171
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,020
Yeah, I was happy to stay at home
Friday night in my underwear...

172
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,540
just tossin'
a football to myself.

173
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,700
Yeah, never did that either.

174
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,780
Well, at least I gave it
my best shot, right?

175
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,540
If Donna loves Casey and not me,
then, I mean, I guess it's over.

176
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,020
Wha... Forman,
you can't give up.

177
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,940
Okay, look. Who knows what's
gonna happen with me and Jackie.

178
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,620
But what you
and Donna had?

179
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,860
That was, like, real.

180
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,100
And I'm telling you, as his brother...
Look, Casey is bad news.

181
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,780
He's either gonna get bored and split,
or something worse is gonna happen.

182
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,660
So, you gotta
do something.

183
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,500
Hey, since when did
you get all serious?

184
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,380
Been reading <i>Cosmo.</i>

185
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,220
It's very educational.

186
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,660
Yeah. I never realized how much
plumbing girls had down there.

187
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,300
Like, there's this diagram,
and it's like a map of Six Flags.

188
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,340
Okay, everyone.
Here's lunch.

189
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,420
Hot dog soup!

190
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,020
No more hot dogs!

191
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,940
I'll just eat
the grilled cheese.

192
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,820
You mean, grilled cheese
with hot dogs!

193
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,580
Kitty, for God's sakes...

194
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,500
I ate 14 hot dogs yesterday!

195
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,980
Well, what do you want me to do, Red?
They're everywhere.

196
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,300
They're a curse
on this house!

197
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,220
Oh, fine.
Let's make some calls.

198
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,420
Maybe we can unload
the damn things on a nursery school.

199
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,020
You guys, I have let this thing
with Casey go way too far.

200
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,580
Yeah, no kidding.
Donna's pretty far gone.

201
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,140
She's starting to lash out
at people at barbecues.

202
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,100
You gotta
kick his ass, man!

203
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,260
Hyde, Eric cannot beat Casey
with his fists.

204
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,900
He's a special boy who must beat him
with his special strengths.

205
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,540
Now, let's think.
What is Eric's special strengths?

206
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,300
Welcome back to TV's
favorite game show...

207
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,100
<i>Get Into That Box!</i>

208
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,340
Now let's meet our returning champion,
Eric Forman!

209
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,580
Thanks.
Good to be back, Fez.

210
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:29,220
Let's meet our challenger,
Casey Kelso!

211
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,500
Casey Kelso,
it's time to...

212
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,780
<i>Get Into That Box!</i>

213
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,660
How does he do it?

214
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,300
He's so tiny!

215
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,100
I would watch that show.

216
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,460
Okay.
That was great.

217
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,660
Guys, I'm going
over to Casey's.

218
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,580
And I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

219
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,700
But if things get physical,
I'm just gonna have to drop the hammer.

220
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,620
And if all else fails,
kick him in the stones and run like hell.

221
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,660
Yeah, that's what I meant by
"drop the hammer."

222
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,460
Rhonda, your lively tongue
has made me thirsty.

223
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,020
Would you like to
wet your whistle?

224
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,700
Wow, thirsty lady.

225
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,980
Well, we're off to
a nice start.

226
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,420
Shall we move on
to second base?

227
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,380
Ay, no.

228
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,660
Guess what. I read your little
"everything's my fault" article...

229
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,420
and I realized
why I cheated.

230
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,460
Remember the first time
I kissed Pam Macy?

231
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,460
- Behind the gym?
- And <i>in</i> the gym, and in her car.

232
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,660
But, anyway...

233
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,140
Earlier that day, I didn't have
any money to buy you Tater Tots.

234
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,380
You said that I'd never be able to
support you, 'cause I wasn't smart enough.

235
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:51,180
You're always puttin' me down like that,
and it makes me feel bad about myself.

236
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,700
And that is why I cheated.

237
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,140
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard!

238
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,380
Just like that.

239
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,980
And then I thought about it,
and I realized that I'm not sorry either!

240
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,060
Hey!

241
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,100
Michael,
what are you saying?

242
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,260
I'm sayin' that we're not right for
each other, because you make me feel bad!

243
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,780
And...

244
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,700
And...

245
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,900
I don't think I can
be with you anymore.

246
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,020
I want to break up.

247
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,980
Wait, break up?

248
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,700
No, no. Michael, I was wrong.
Please, let's talk about this.

249
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,020
- No.
- Wait, but Michael!

250
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,660
Casey, we need to talk.

251
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,220
Well, I'm a little swamped
right now, Foreplay.

252
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,100
I think Donna thinks
you love her...

253
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,260
and if you don't,
you shouldn't act like you do.

254
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,700
What are you?
The love police?

255
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,180
Hands up!
Love police is here.

256
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,260
Hey, all I'm saying is that
if you don't love her...

257
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,300
just don't be with her, okay?

258
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,820
Because she's
a really special person...

259
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,660
and someone out there
could really love her.

260
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,980
Someone out there
or someone right here?

261
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,340
Oh, hey, Eric.
What are you doing here?

262
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,260
He was just leaving.

263
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,460
Oh. Well,
I gotta go too.

264
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,420
Hey, Pinciotti.

265
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,660
Love ya.

266
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,580
Oh, well, I...

267
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,340
Thank you.

268
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,580
Okay, well I'll, uh,
I'll see you later.

269
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,420
You see, Forman,
it's just words.

270
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,380
You don't have to mean it.

271
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:06,100
If you make her cry,
I'm coming right back here to kick your ass.

272
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,780
Well, me and Jackie
are officially over.

273
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,140
We're as done
as this hot dog.

274
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,140
This hot dog isn't done!

275
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,940
Well, if kicking Casey's butt is the same
as babbling at him from a safe distance...

276
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,380
then, boy, did I do it!

277
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,100
But seriously, you guys,
the days of Daffy are over.

278
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,780
It's time for action.

279
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,740
I'm goin' Road Runner
on his ass.

280
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,700
Beep, beep!
Pow!

281
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,060
Good.

282
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,060
Because thanks to his stupid advice,
Rhonda dumped me.

283
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,580
I tried to steal third,
but she blocked me...

284
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,540
and choked me.

285
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,540
Now there is
no more baseball for Fez.

286
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,460
It's back to handball.

287
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,420
Girls, man.
They'll make you miserable.

288
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,540
Well, I got a date.

289
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,620
"Tho" long, "thuckerth!"

290
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,820
It's like <i>Playboy...</i>

291
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,140
but girls look at it.

292
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,020
I know.
How hot is that?

293
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,220
Oh, look. Six Flags!

294
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,060
Well, that better not be
a dirty magazine.

295
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,700
Oh, <i>Cosmo.</i>
Good for you.

296
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,820
<i>Cosmo?</i>

297
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,100
You boys are spending
too much time together.

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Any good mail?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,000
Well, we got the new
Yarn Barn catalog.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
And the model is
showing cleavage?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,700
You know, if I want that in my house,
I will watch <i>McMillan and Wife.</i>

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,400
Oh, Steven got a letter
from Department of Motor Vehicles.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,700
What?
Another damn ticket?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,500
Hey, screw-head!

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,800
Why is the D.M.V.
sending you letters?

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,500
- ( Chuckles ) Screw-head. Hey, screw-head.
- <i>( Slaps Butt )</i>

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,200
No, no, no.
You're screw-head.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm just called ''boy.''

12
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,100
I got a letter
from the D.M.V.?

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,700
Oh, my God.
It's about the cow.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Did I say ''cow''?

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Because what I meant
was <i>countdown</i>-

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,000
countdown to better driving.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,900
I think what Eric's trying
to say is, he hit a cow.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,500
Wait-

19
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,900
Well, I had
the right-of-way!

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,900
Go ahead.
Open it, hot rod.

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,700
You know, you are
the most irresponsible...

22
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,600
careless, no-account, undisc-

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,900
Oh, it's a license renewal
for my 1 8th birthday.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
Oh.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,100
Happy birthday!
( Chuckles )

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,300
Guess who gets 1 8 hugs the day
before his 1 8th birthday?

27
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,400
One, two-
Everyone!

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,300
- ( All ) Three, four, five-
- Okay.

29
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,000
- six, seven, eight-
- Okay. All right, all right!

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,800
Thanks, Mrs. Forman,
but you can drop it.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not really into birthdays,
especially this one.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,800
- Oh, no, you don't! Nine, ten-
- Get off me, spaz!

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,500
Oh, Steven likes birthdays.
He just doesn't know it.

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,400
Which is why we're throwing him
a surprise party.

35
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,400
Now, I need two helpers with keen
feminine sensibilities to help decorate.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,100
Jackie and Fez.

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Yea.

38
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,800
What the hell?
I'm feminine.

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,200
I should kick her ass
for that.

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Hey,Jackie, while you're up
there, try not to kiss any more guys!

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,500
Man, are you guys
still fighting about that?

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
You gotta come down hard
on stuff like this.

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,500
If she'd have come down harder on me
when I was cheating, I would've-

44
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,800
Well, I would have been
way sneakier about it.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
You know what, you guys?
Eighteen is a big deal.

46
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,800
We ought to get Hyde,
like, the perfect Hyde gift.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,400
So, you know what? Let's try to put
ourselves in a total Hyde state of mind.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,500
( Chuckling )
Yeah.

49
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,100
Okay, now, what
would Hyde want?

50
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,100
Something... stolen.

51
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Stolen's good.
But you know what's better?

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
- ( Snaps Fingers )
- Stolen and dirty!

53
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,600
So what's a good gift
for Hyde that's stolen and dirty?

54
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,200
Someone else's pig!

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,400
No, no, wait!
I got it! I got it!

56
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,300
A street sign.

57
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,100
We'll steal it,
so it'll be stolen...

58
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,800
and it's dirty,
so it'll be dirty.

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,900
Oh, my God.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,600
Kelso just solved
his first word problem. Ohh!

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,600
Yeah, I learned those
in Miss Carter's class...

62
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,400
'cause I knew if I got one right
that'd she'd give me a hug.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,700
No bra and they
were <i>always</i> pointy.

64
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,400
Now, that's good teachin'.

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,600
No problem.
You can have Hyde's party here.

66
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,900
There's only one thing I ask.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Can I come?

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,200
The party's at your house, Bob.
Of course you're invited.

69
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, boy, I'm in!

70
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,100
I'll get my
Anne Murray albums!

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,700
Okay, now, you two.

72
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,200
I want this party to look nice.
So, um, balloons, streamers-

73
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,600
whatever makes Steven forget
he has no parents.

74
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,000
So, Fez, how do you want
to decorate this place?

75
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,700
- Well, what I'm thinking-
- No, no, no. I want <i>Arabian Nights</i>-

76
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,600
veils, Persian rugs.

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Uh-huh.
One question,Jackie.

78
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,600
Is this a party for Hyde,
or a bunch of whores in a whorehouse?

79
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
Oh, yeah. Check it out!
''High Street.''

80
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Oh, man.
Hyde's gonna love this.

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,900
- Here, Donna, I'll give you a boost.
- Okay.

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,000
One, two, three.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,700
Oh, yeah!

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Fingers!

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,400
- Oh!
- Come on, Eric. I'll give you a boost.

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,300
No way.

87
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Why not?

88
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,600
Because you'll throw me.

89
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,600
What? No, I won't!

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
( Chuckles )
Yeah, I will.

91
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,700
Look. How about we stand on top
of the van and reach it?

92
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,200
I think not!
We'll dent the roof.

93
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,500
I don't want nothin'
to happen to the ''love bus.''

94
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay, I got it.
I got a better idea.

95
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Okay,just make sure
it's tight.

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,100
Right. Okay,
you're good to go.

97
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, at least
the roof s okay.

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
Steven!

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,300
I thought you were at work.

100
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,300
Not till later.

101
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,900
Why are you baking
so many cupcakes?

102
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,800
I had four dozen eggs.
They were gonna go bad.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,200
( Clears Throat )
Mrs. Forman, I don't want a party.

104
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,200
And I'm not saying that
because I'm fishing for a party.

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,500
I mean,
I don't want a party.

106
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,800
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause I know how this family works.

107
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,300
You guys say you don't want stuff
that you actually want.

108
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,800
Like on Mother's Day.
You said you didn't want a fuss.

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,000
But you did want a fuss.
So we made a fuss, and you were happy?

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,900
That can drive a guy nuts.

111
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,200
It really can.

112
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,300
So now, I don't know
what to do...

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,300
or say or not say...

114
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,300
because I really
don't want a party.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,700
Well, I don't wanna
do anything you don't want.

116
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,500
See, I don't know
what that means!

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,800
Well, it means
there's no party.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Oh, please. Would I lie to you
about making you a party?

119
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,700
I am hurt.

120
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,800
Fine.

121
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,500
Okay. I'm sorry.

122
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,400
- You lied.
- No, no.

123
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,200
I said, ''Would I lie?''

124
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,100
It was very tricky.
I was like Houdini, but with words.

125
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,400
The base of the sign's
all cracked.

126
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,100
So all we have to do is shove this
firecracker in there, and blammo!

127
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,200
The sign comes down.

128
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
Wow, it could actually work...

129
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
if the base were
made of pudding!

130
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,100
If the base were made
of pudding, Eric...

131
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,800
we could just
pull the sign right out.

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,100
( Singsong Voice )
Okay, get ready to run!

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,700
Huh.

134
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,800
Must be a dud.

135
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Go find out.

136
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,800
- Why me?
- 'Cause you're super skinny.

137
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,000
If it blows up, you got the best chance
of having stuff not hit you.

138
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,400
True, but on
the other hand...

139
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,800
no one would be surprised
if you blew yourself up.

140
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,000
That's a good point.

141
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,100
Oh,just move.

142
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Here, you big babies.

143
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,900
Okay, what you just did,
just there?

144
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,200
That was so hot.

145
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,300
I'd follow your fine behind
into combat any day.

146
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,200
All right, look. If we got
Red's tools, I bet I could cut down that pole.

147
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,600
Casey showed me how
to saw through rebar.

148
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,800
Our second date.

149
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,300
Wow. I love those stories.

150
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,600
Hey, I'll just sneak into your garage,
grab the tools. Red'll never know.

151
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,200
Okay, but you gotta
be really quiet.

152
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,300
Come on. It's me we're talking about.
I'm like a cat.

153
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,600
( Sighs )

154
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,400
( Clears Throat )

155
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,700
( Gasps )
Red.

156
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,300
Hey.

157
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
You're wonderin' why I'm goin'
through your stuff.

158
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Okay. That's-

159
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,000
See, I needed,
uh, to borrow...

160
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,800
your saw...

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,400
because I need
to chop down a tree.

162
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,900
Because there's something
stuck in it.

163
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,000
An animal. A rabbit.

164
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,200
There's a rabbit
stuck in a tree.

165
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,700
And I want to return
that rabbit to the wild...

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,200
so it can lay its eggs.

167
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,700
Kelso, rabbits don't-

168
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,600
How the hell did
a rabbit get up a tree?

169
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,900
Uh, Eric threw it
up there.

170
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Eric threw a rabbit
up a tree?

171
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,200
Yeah.
He's a sadistic bastard.

172
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
You know he hit a cow?

173
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,100
You know, you've been in
a bad mood all night, man.

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm gonna cheer you up.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,900
Ah, boo!

176
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,900
Ah, boo!

177
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,900
( Blathering )

178
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Aw, you don't know
what's funny.

179
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, hey, uh, I can work
tomorrow night if you want me to.

180
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,100
You're not working tomorrow, man.
It's your birthday.

181
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,100
Yeah, man, my 1 8th birthday.
Otherwise known as the beginning of the end.

182
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,000
The black hole, man.
It's the death march.

183
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,400
Look, if there's a war,
I could get drafted.

184
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,700
If there's a war, I'll see you in Canada.
( Chuckles )

185
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,400
That's not the point, Leo.
I mean, there's other stuff too, you know.

186
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,600
Hey, don't get snippy
with me, man.

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
Hyde, we need you
to settle an argument.

188
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sure you know by now that
we're throwing you a party.

189
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,400
What party?

190
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,200
Okay, I'm sure
you know by <i>now...</i>

191
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
that we're throwing
you a party.

192
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,800
So, what kind of theme
would you like?

193
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,400
Throw whatever party you want, man.
I'm not gonna be there.

194
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,900
Well, if that's his attitude,
I don't wanna do anything. I quit.

195
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
You can't quit on me.

196
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,500
I quit on you...

197
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,600
you bossy little midget.

198
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,400
Don't even.

199
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,600
- What the hell?
- No! No!

200
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,200
Excuse me,
little boy with glasses.

201
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,100
That's our sign.

202
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,600
Um, excuse me,
big dork with Farrah hair.

203
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
No, it isn't.

204
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
''Farrah hair''?

205
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,600
If I look like any of the Charlie's Angels,
it's Jaclyn Smith!

206
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Wow, that's true.

207
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,700
Hey, there, little fella.

208
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,500
What if I told you
that I had $20...

209
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,700
for a special someone
if they gave us the sign?

210
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,900
- Nope.
- A month's supply of candy?

211
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,200
- Nope.
- What if...

212
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,500
I show you my bra strap?

213
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Okay.

214
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,200
( Kelso, Eric )
Okay!

215
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,700
Here.

216
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,600
I bet if I showed him my whole bra,
he would have given me his bike.

217
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
These things are awesome.

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
That was hot.

219
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Man, why is she
so hot today?

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,600
'Cause you can't have her,
'cause you lost her, 'cause you're stupid.

221
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,700
Wait. Um,Jackie cheated on you,
right, with a little, tiny cheese guy?

222
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey! Truce, okay?

223
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,100
- Yeah, I think that's best.
- Yeah.

224
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Hey, if you hadn't
blown it with Donna...

225
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,300
-you'd probably be doin' it with her right now.
- <i>( Chuckles ) Yeah.!</i>

226
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,400
You know who's probably doin' it?
Jackie, with the cheese guy.

227
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,500
We had a truce!

228
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,100
Wow.

229
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Yeah, this place looks great.

230
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,500
Fez,Jackie,
the decorations are beautiful.

231
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
No. No, no, no, no.

232
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
They haven't
been here all day.

233
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,900
I did this because
I'm feminine too.

234
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm a lady.
Why can't anyone freakin' see that?

235
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,600
Oh, honey, no.
It's perfect.

236
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,100
Okay, the next time I need a feminine touch,
I am using you and Fez.

237
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,900
What happened
to those cupcakes?

238
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,000
Bob, there were
a dozen cupcakes there.

239
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm sorry, Red.
They're like vitamins to me.

240
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,200
Hey, you guys.
Bad news.

241
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,900
Hyde said he's not coming.
He's just sitting in the basement.

242
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Oh, but it's his birthday.
He can't be alone on his birthday.

243
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Red?

244
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,900
I agree. Eric, you go home
and sit with Steven.

245
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, okay, fine.
I'll go get him.

246
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,400
Surprise!

247
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,500
( Chuckles )
We got him, dudes.

248
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,700
All right. Get your butt up
those stairs and over to your party.

249
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm not goin'.

250
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,500
Steven, you're 1 8 now.
It's time to start being a man.

251
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,400
And the first rule
to being a man is...

252
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,400
you gotta spend your life
doing crap you don't wanna do.

253
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Like right now,
I don't wanna be here talkin' to you...

254
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
but I am.

255
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,800
And you don't wanna
go to a party...

256
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,100
but you will.

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,300
Actually, I won't.

258
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,500
( Mockingly Sympathetic )
What's the matter?

259
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
You don't like parties?

260
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,700
<i>Me neither.</i>

261
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,000
But as long as
you're livin' under my roof...

262
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
you'll do what
I tell you to do.

263
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,600
Well, lucky for me, I won't be
under your roof much longer anyway.

264
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,700
What the hell
you talkin' about?

265
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,400
Well, I'm 1 8.
I should be getting out of here, right?

266
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,300
I mean, that's what my dad did
and my uncle did and my cousins did.

267
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
They were all on their own
when they were my age.

268
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,700
What are they doin' now?

269
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,600
Uh, pumping gas, prison,
prison, dead, prison.

270
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,700
And the reason
you're living here...

271
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,300
is so you don't
end up like them.

272
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,800
But if you want to leave,
I can't stop you.

273
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,000
So, what's it gonna be, Steven?

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,600
Prison, death
or a birthday party?

275
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,400
I guess
I'll go to the party.

276
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,200
( Clears Throat )
Thanks, Red.

277
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,000
You're welcome.
And, uh...

278
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,700
don't tell Eric that we had
this little conversation.

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,400
'Cause when he's 1 8,
he's out.

280
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,000
So, punch.

281
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Yep.

282
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,400
Oh, fine.

283
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,300
Everybody, they're here!
They're- Shh! Shh!

284
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,400
( All )
Surprise!

285
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,300
You got me, dudes.

286
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,100
Wow, thanks.

287
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,600
Oh, happy birthday.

288
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,700
Damn,Jackie!
Stop kissing other guys!

289

( Humming Fanfare )

290
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,600
Wow, this is great.
Did you get this at the flea market?

291
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,000
- The flea market?
- Yeah, they sell 'em there for two bucks.

292
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,800
No, we stole it.
It took forever.

293
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,600
I had to show my bra!

294
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,300
You owe me a bumper!

295
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,600
Now, I made this
for you. See?

296
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,300
It says ''Steven''
on the front...

297
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,800
because I heard that having your name
on your clothes is cool.

298
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Plus, if anybody finds it,
they can return it to you.

299
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,200
So, I won't be able
to lose it.

300
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,700
- Great.
- ( Laughing )

301
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Put it on.

302
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
Do I have to?

303
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,100
You bet your ass.

304
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,300
Welcome to manhood.

Mrs. Forman...

307
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm not really
a pinata kind of guy.

308
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh, come on, Steven.
Everyone plays pinata.

309
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,300
Yeah, Steven.
Hit the jackass!

310
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,200
Ow! Hey!

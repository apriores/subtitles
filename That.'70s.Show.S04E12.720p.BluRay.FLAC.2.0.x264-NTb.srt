1
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:08,099
So, Eric, have you made
your Christmas list for Santa yet?

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:11,459
Well, um, I was going to,
but then I turned 10.

3
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:16,459
Steven made his.

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,939
T-shirts.

5
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:22,979
Well, I guess I could ask for a
cassette player for the Vista Cruiser...

6
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,859
like I have for
the last... 80 years.

7
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,779
But I won't get one, so I might as well
just ask for a raincoat.

8
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:34,459
Oh, so you want
a raincoat?

9
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:39,219
Man, remember when you used to come
downstairs Christmas morning...

10
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,459
and you'd see your stocking over
the fire all filled with toys?

11
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:46,979
Well, one year, I saw my mom's panty hose
on the radiator...

12
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,339
and, uh, Uncle "Strange Man"
sleeping on the floor.

13
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:54,699
He had a red nose though.
That's Christmassy.

14
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:57,259
Yeah, Christmas
used to be so cool.

15
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:00,939
- Now it's just another day.
- Okay. Okay.

16
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,099
It sounds like somebody needs
a little holiday cheer.

17
00:01:04,179 --> 00:01:06,939
I know!

18
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,299
You could direct the Christmas pageant
at the church.

19
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:14,619
Hey, yeah, that's the worst idea
I've ever heard!

20
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,659
Eric, you used to love that pageant
when you were a little boy.

21
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:21,099
And you need some Christmas spirit.
And I already signed you up.

22
00:01:23,419 --> 00:01:27,339
Well, it was fun
when we were kids.

23
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:30,939
Then again, so was eating crayons.
Yeah, okay.

24
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,339
- I'll do it.
- Good. Okay, now, Steven...

25
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:35,299
No!

26
00:01:35,379 --> 00:01:37,899
No!

27
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,819
Oh.

28
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,779
So you won't be in a show about
how there was no room at the inn...

29
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,939
even though this innkeeper
gave you a room?

30
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,059
Your guilt has
no power over me!

31
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:52,379
I'll do it.

32
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:56,539
Fa la la la la La la la... boned

33
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,519
Guys, check this out.
It looks just like when we were kids.

34
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,679
And look,
the wise-men gifts:

35
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,119
Gold, myrrh, and...

36
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,839
Hyde, I think this one's yours.

37
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,479
That'd be my Baggie
of frankincense.

38
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:55,799
Well, if it isn't
Mr. First-time Director.

39
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,319
I thought I'd direct,
but the church board...

40
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:02,039
whose average age is...
nearly dead...

41
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:04,559
feels that I don't speak
to the younger generation.

42
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,879
Oh, Pastor Dave, I loved last year's
<i>Silent Night, Jazzy Night.</i>

43
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,799
It was really funny.

44
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,799
It was a drama.

45
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,919
You guys, you guys! Great news.

46
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:21,159
<i>Rudolph, Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,</i>
<i>The Little Drummer Boy...</i>

47
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,359
They're all on TV this week!

48
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,519
We can watch 'em!

49
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,599
Yeah! We can wear our p.j.'s...

50
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,559
and eat gumdrops
and drink Kool-Aid.

51
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:37,519
Hooray!

52
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,839
Yeah!

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,079
Okay, guys, let's talk about
your parts.

54
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,999
Okay, Eric, I want
to be the Virgin Mary.

55
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,799
See, she's pure and holy
and rides a unicorn.

56
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:59,639
No, Jackie, she doesn't
ride a unicorn.

57
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,599
She does now.

58
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,479
A white unicorn
with speckles.

59
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:07,079
Write that down.

60
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,679
Hey, is there anyone in this show who
just kind of lies there and does nothing?

61
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,039
Um, there's the baby
in the manger.

62
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,999
I call baby in the manger!

63
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,199
Uh, Eric, I don't want
to play Joseph as a carpenter.

64
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,759
Oh, how about if I play
him as a spaceman?

65
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,799
Okay, uh, Kelso, I don't think Jesus
was the son of a spaceman.

66
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,239
Oh, really? Well, where
do you think God lives?

67
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,479
It's true, man.

68
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,879
What the hell?

69
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,119
It's the Russians!

70
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,839
Aw, geez.

71
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:06,999
Bob!

72
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>Hey there, hi there, ho-ho-ho there!</i>

73
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:15,359
Bob, it's midnight.
Turn that crap off.

74
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,159
<i>What would I do that for?</i>

75
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,959
<i>Hey, check out</i>
<i>the keister on Mrs. Claus.</i>

76
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,519
<i>I know what I want for Christmas!</i>

77
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:30,919
Bob, are you drunk?

78
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,679
<i>I'm not sober!</i>

79
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,839
Eric, I have a little
problem with my part.

80
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,839
Um, it turns out you have me
playing a wise <i>man.</i>

81
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,759
Why can't there be
any wise <i>women?</i>

82
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,079
Yeah, okay. I'll take that up
with the guy who wrote the Bible.

83
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,199
Let me get back to you.

84
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,959
Okay, Kelso, you are now
playing a wise man.

85
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,439
- Or a space wise man.
- Better. Better.

86
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,839
How come the foreign guy
has to play the shepherd?

87
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,359
I have never herded sheep
in my life.

88
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:29,519
Well, once, as a favor.

89
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,919
Why can't I be a lifeguard?

90
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,519
Or a space lifeguard.

91
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:41,919
Then I could herd all
the ladies into the pool.

92
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,359
"Into the pool, ladies!"

93
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,319
Now, that's a good role.

94
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,039
Okay, uh, everyone?
Everybody?

95
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,799
Um, all of your ideas are all...

96
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,599
um, stupid.

97
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:05,479
Okay, moving on. Uh, at the end of the play,
when Santa comes in the door...

98
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,399
- Ooh! How about...
- Kelso, I swear to God...

99
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,079
if you say Space Santa,
I'm gonna kick you in the head.

100
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,919
Never mind.

101
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:39,719
Red, are you stealing Bob's
Christmas decorations?

102
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,079
It's only stealing if you, uh...
if you keep it.

103
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,919
I'm throwing
all this crap away.

104
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,479
Oh, my God.
I'm married to the Grinch.

105
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,679
I'm Mrs. Grinch.

106
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,639
Well, as long as you're not
Mrs. Tattletale, we'll be fine.

107
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,639
Leo, these guys are
driving me crazy in there.

108
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:13,319
Do you know what they
think is Christmassy? Unicorns.

109
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,999
Right... No, I'm sorry.
Space unicorns.

110
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,119
Well, that's redundant.

111
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,479
Do you have any idea what
this is gonna look like, man?

112
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,279
Shark!
Everybody out of the water!

113
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:40,639
And off with your tops!

114
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,839
Make way!
Virgin Mother coming through!

115
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,839
We come bearing gifts
of frankincense, myrrh...

116
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,439
and <i>Led Zeppelin IV.</i>

117
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,359
Now, let me get a look at that
cute little baby <i>girl</i> Jesus!

118
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,399
I'm just gonna go home.
<i>Holiday Inn's</i> on TV.

119
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:21,719
Now, <i>that's</i> Christmas.

120
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:26,079
You can't go home, man.
This pageant's your chance...

121
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:30,599
to spread some Christmas spirit,
and that's contagious, like V.D.

122
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:38,679
I just... I don't think
I have it anymore, Leo.

123
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,839
Ah, don't be fooled, man.
V.D. Comes back.

124
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:52,039
No, not...

125
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:54,039
Okay. Yeah,
I'll watch for that.

126
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:00,679
So. Dipping into
the frankincense, I see.

127
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:05,279
Well, no more of that. Okay? We're gonna
do this play the way it was meant to be done.

128
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:07,879
And no spacemen.

129
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,159
And anyone who doesn't like that
is no Christmas friend of mine.

130
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,519
And we should be a little bit nicer to those
of us who want to watch Christmas specials.

131
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:21,079
I mean, when Rudolph's nose
shone so bright...

132
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,439
and Santa realized he could
guide the sleigh at night...

133
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,119
That was a great moment
in American history.

134
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,639
Kelso, Rudolph was small,
had a girlie voice...

135
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,919
and I'm pretty sure he was
a little light in the hooves...

136
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,159
if you know what I mean.

137
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:40,119
Of course he was light in the hooves.
He could fly!

138
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,999
I would have guessed Prancer.

139
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:52,799
Well, you've all ignored me, so I'll take
that as a resounding vote of confidence.

140
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,079
Guys, let's do this thing!

141
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,879
- What on God's green earth?
- But Pastor Dave, I was just...

142
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,199
I know what you were doing. I recognize
that smell from the AC/DC concert.

143
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,599
I was handing out leaflets!

144
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,839
- No, but I wasn't...
- Eric Forman, you're fired.

145
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,959
You know what?
Fine.

146
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:25,159
Rudolph had a girlfriend!
Her name was Clarice.

147
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:30,399
She thought he was cute. Okay, if
anyone was gay, it was that-that Hermey.

148
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,599
No straight elf
has hair like that.

149
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:45,759
Well, as you may know by now,
I had to let Eric go.

150
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,639
Wait, you fired Eric?
Who's gonna direct the play?

151
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:54,679
I guess that responsibility
falls "unto me."

152
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:58,039
And I am willing to be the reluctant hero
on this year's pageant...

153
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:01,159
and whip all you
ne'er-do-wells into shape.

154
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,839
Okay, kids,
that was a good one.

155
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:18,039
Now, let's work on the scene
where you untie me.

156
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,999
And action!

157
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,879
Give me my
stuff back, Red!

158
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:33,119
Don't know what
you're talking about, Bob.

159
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:35,759
And no!

160
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,679
Oh, Red, just give it back.

161
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,439
You don't want anybody
to have a happy Christmas!

162
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,439
Oh, you want happy?
Drink another six-pack.

163
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,439
Oh, this is nice.
This is great.

164
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:51,639
I guess we have a new tradition here:
The annual yuletide fight.

165
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:57,239
God, can't anybody just act decent
for one freakin' day of the year?

166
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:08,679
Well, out of
the mouths of babes, huh?

167
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:13,559
Well, fine.

168
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,319
Bob, your decorations are in the Dumpster
behind the liquor store.

169
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,439
Thanks, Red.

170
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,199
If I had mistletoe,
I'd kiss you.

171
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,639
Yeah, well, if I had "mistlefoot,"
it'd be in your ass.

172
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,799
You know what
I would like for Christmas?

173
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,839
No more talk about you putting your foot
in other people's rear ends.

174
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,919
Maybe next year, Kitty.

175
00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,039
Whoa, dudes.
What'd you do, man?

176
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,199
Leo, man. We're just about
to light the Dave.

177
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,199
I can't believe you guys.
You managed to bring a man of God to tears.

178
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,679
I'm not crying!

179
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,279
I'm talking about me, man.

180
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:18,759
You know, you guys can hassle
your skinny friend, Eric...

181
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,559
but when it comes down
to a fundamental moral core...

182
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,279
he's the only one of you
that's got one.

183
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:28,239
So, congratulations.
You've ruined Christmas.

184
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:36,159
Oh, man. Leo's right.
I mean, this probably isn't our finest hour.

185
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,999
I don't know.
It's pretty damn fine.

186
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,439
Well, Jackie, you know,
since everything's ruined...

187
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,119
we could... I don't know...
go home and watch <i>Rudolph.</i>

188
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,439
Michael, those shows
are for babies.

189
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,559
But I want to watch it!

190
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,519
I wanna!

191
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:01,479
Grow up, Michael.

192
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,759
You never let me have any fun!

193
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,239
You guys, I feel
kind of bad about Eric.

194
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:13,319
- Yeah, maybe we should go find him.
- Yeah.

195
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,799
Or we could stay here
and wrap Dave.

196
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,359
- I say, get Eric!
- Come on.

197
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,519
Uh, guys?

198
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,519
Oh, right.

199
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,919
There you go.

200
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,399
Oh, honey,
you looked so sad.

201
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:46,679
I am gonna let you open your
big Christmas present early.

202
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,359
Wow, it's kind of the size of...

203
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:52,359
And it's kind
of heavy like...

204
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:56,959
- I knew you wanted one.
- I can't believe that you got me... a rain coat!

205
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:02,999
See, it's London Fog!
Did I fool you?

206
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:05,439
I put rocks in the bottom,
so it would seem heavy.

207
00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:13,399
That's clever.

208
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:16,679
Okay, now. I'm gonna
wrap it back up.

209
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,559
You can open it Christmas morning
and pretend you're surprised.

210
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,639
Uh-huh. So, we got
that to look forward to.

211
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,839
Okay!

212
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:42,719
Huh?

213
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,079
What's the matter, Kelso?

214
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,479
Rudolph,
I can't watch you anymore.

215
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,639
- My friends say I'm too old.
- Ho-Ho-Hold the phone!

216
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:55,159
Too old for Christmas?
That's nonsense.

217
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,799
Yeah, but everyone's
makin' fun of me.

218
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,519
You know, Kelso, people used to laugh
and call me names.

219
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:03,639
"They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
join in any reindeer games."

220
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,319
- So, what did you do?
- I kicked 'em in the face.

221
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,159
Blitzen bled like a faucet.

222
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,119
Little Drummer Boy,
what are you doing here?

223
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,039
- Come, they told me.
- No, but what am I supposed to do?

224
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,919
All my friends are gonna think that
I'm a baby if I keep watching your shows.

225
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,199
Aw, screw those dumb-asses!

226
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,519
If they're too old for Christmas specials,
that's their loss.

227
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,919
Can I go now?
I'm very cold.

228
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:34,999
Kelso, as long as you really,
really believe in our magical world...

229
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,879
nothing in life
can ever hurt you.

230
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,359
So, I can watch.

231
00:17:40,439 --> 00:17:42,519
I can watch!

232
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:46,399
Whoo-hoo! I can watch!

233
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:50,319
I can watch! I can watch!

234
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,599
- Look at that face.
- What a nice kid.

235
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,319
I'm not too late.
I haven't missed them!

236
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,439
- Hey, Dave.
- Uh, Michael?

237
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,159
- A little help?
- Oh.

238
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,879
That wasn't fun.
One of the lights burned my neck.

239
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,199
You know, Pastor Dave, the only reason
we mess with you is 'cause we like you.

240
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,599
You do? You do!

241
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,679
I'm cool! I'm cool!

242
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:45,679
Oh, well, if it isn't the dill-holes
of Christmas past, present and future.

243
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:49,279
We came to talk to you
about the pageant.

244
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,759
- Dave said he'll un-fire you.
- 'Cause I'm cool!

245
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,599
And we'll do the pageant
however you want.

246
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,159
Yeah, I set 'em straight, man.

247
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:01,439
Look, Forman, just
come on back, all right?

248
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,999
- Yeah, it'll be fun.
- Yeah. We can all be together.

249
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,239
I mean, it's Christmas,
you know?

250
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,639
Plus, we got you a present.

251
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:15,639
Oh, man.
A cassette deck.

252
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,399
You guys, thanks.

253
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:23,759
- So, you'll come back?
- Yeah, okay.

254
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,959
Ohh. Merry Christmas,
Charlie Brown!

255
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:42,039
Hey, those decorations aren't half bad.

256
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,839
Look, it's snowing!

257
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:47,399
Yeah, I hooked up
the snow machine.

258
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,119
Don't nobody smoke though.
This stuff might be toxic.

259
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,839
Ohh, a tape player.

260
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,759
Didn't know you wanted one of those!

261
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:02,079
Isn't it beautiful?

262
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,359
Hey, Steven.
Fix that light up there, will ya?

263
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,999
- Ah, I dropped my candy!
- Oh, no!

264
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,599
Oh! Ah, my knee!

265
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:18,799
How's that?

266
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,899
Behold! The virgin has given birth.

267
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:37,699
Isn't he cute? He's got my eyes.

268
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:40,459
And my hair.

269
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,819
Hark, we come bearing gifts!

270
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,059
- Gifts from space!
- <i>Kelso!</i>

271
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,699
No! Earth air! Toxic! Choking!

272
00:20:55,979 --> 00:20:58,259
God bless us, everyone.
